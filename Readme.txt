--This pipeline in the question is a multi-stage deployment pipeline for a Docker image using Azure DevOps. 
The pipeline has three stages: Build, Deploy, and Deploy1.

-Build Stage

The Build stage has a single job named "Build" that runs in an Ubuntu virtual machine. The job has several steps, which are:(buildstage)
1)Installing required packages: A virtual environment is created and the required packages are installed.
2)Testing the project: The project is tested using unit tests.
3)Building the Docker image: A Docker image is built using the Dockerfile.
4)PublishTestResults: The test results are published.
5)Docker Build and Docker Push: The Docker image is built and pushed to a container registry named ipapadod
6)Deploy Stage

-The Deploy stage has a single job named "Deploy" that runs in an Ubuntu virtual machine. The job uses a "runOnce" deployment strategy and has two steps:

1)CopyFiles: Files from the default working directory are copied to the remote machine.
2)SSH: The Docker image is pulled and run on the remote machine using an SSH connection. (ssh_connection)

-Deploy1 Stage
The Deploy1 stage has a single job named "Deploy" that runs in an Ubuntu virtual machine. The job uses a "runOnce" deployment strategy and has two steps:

1)Kubernetes apply (Service): A Kubernetes service is created using a YAML file.
2)Kubernetes apply (Deployment): A Kubernetes deployment is created using a YAML file.


--Technologies and Tools used

1)Azure DevOps: Used for creating and managing the pipeline.
2)Docker: Used for building and pushing the Docker image.
3)Kubernetes: Used for deploying the Docker image to a cluster.
4)SSH: Used for connecting to a remote machine. (ssh_connection)
5)Python: Used for testing the project.
6)YAML: Used for defining the Kubernetes service and deployment.

--Steps to set up the pipeline
Create a new Azure DevOps project.
Create a new pipeline in the project.
Configure the pipeline variables (imageName, containerRegistry, repository, and sshEndpoint).
Add the stages and jobs to the pipeline.
Add the tasks to each job.
Save and run the pipeline.

In this example, ServiceA is the entry point to the system. It makes a request to ServiceB and ServiceC. ServiceB and ServiceC in turn can call each other if needed.

Also, in the example, i am using the python requests library to make HTTP calls

=========== pipeline =============
Build pipeline:

The pipeline is triggered when changes are pushed to the repository.
The pipeline checks out the source code from the repository.
It then uses a build task to build the application.
After the build, it creates a Docker image of each service using a task such as the "Docker" task in Azure DevOps.
Finally, it pushes the images to a container registry Docker Hub.


Test pipeline:

The pipeline is triggered when a new Docker image is available in the container registry.
The pipeline pulls the latest image from the container registry.
It then runs a set of tests against the image.
If the tests pass, the pipeline proceeds to the next step.
If the tests fail, the pipeline stops and sends a notification to the development team.


Deploy pipeline:

The pipeline is triggered when the test pipeline completes successfully.
The pipeline deploys the services to a cloud provider ...

**Observations**

Since i am using free tier azure devops, i couldnt run pipelines[(1)]pipeline's error).
i needed to ask for parallelism and wait 2-3 days[(2)]pipeline's error).
pulled it manually to my local virtual machine (dockerpull)
